# C-H-S structures at 250GPa
This repository contains a selection of the structural data and DOS plots of the paper [Missing theoretical evidence for conventional room temperature superconductivity in low enthalpy structures of
carbonaceous sulfur hydrides](https://journals.aps.org/prmaterials/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.014801). Please cite this paper if you use the data from this repository.

All structures that do not differ more than 20 meV per atom from the putative global minimum
of a stochiometry are presented here.

## Naming of .in files
The structure files are named using the following convention:
{stochoimetry}_{number of local minimum}.in were 0 corresponds to the minimum with the lowest enthalpy.
## Additional data in .in files
The first comment line of each .in file contains the following data:
The number of atoms, units of the file and the enthalpy of the structure in eV calculated
with FHI-AIMS - an all electron DFT library. The data is separated by spaces. A detailed
description of the .in file format can be found [here](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/22871930 ".in file format").
