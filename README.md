# C-H-S structures at 250GPa
This repository contains the structural data and DOS plots of the paper [Missing theoretical evidence for conventional room temperature superconductivity in low enthalpy structures of a
carbonaceous sulfur hydride](https://www.overleaf.com).
Please cite this paper if you use the data from this repository.

The first comment line of each .in file contains the following data:
The number of atoms, units of the file and the enthalpy of the structure calculated
with FHI-AIMS - an all electron DFT library. The data is separated by spaces.
