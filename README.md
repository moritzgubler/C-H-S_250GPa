# C-H-S structures at 250GPa
This repository contains a selection of the structural data and DOS plots of the paper [Missing theoretical evidence for conventional room temperature superconductivity in low enthalpy structures of a
carbonaceous sulfur hydride](https://www.overleaf.com). Please cite this paper if you use the data from this repository.

All structures that do not differ more than 20 meV per atom from the putative global minimum
of a stochiometry are presented here.

## Naming of .in files
The structure files are named using the following convention:
{stochoimetry}_{number of local minimum}.in

## Additional data in .in files
The first comment line of each .in file contains the following data:
The number of atoms, units of the file and the enthalpy of the structure in eV calculated
with FHI-AIMS - an all electron DFT library. The data is separated by spaces.
